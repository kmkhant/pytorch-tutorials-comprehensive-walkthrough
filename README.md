# PyTorch Tutorials & Examples: Beginner-Friendly Explanations

I created this repository while learning from the official [PyTorch examples and tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/). My goal is to help beginners like myself by providing:

- **Modified and enhanced code** from the original PyTorch resources.
- **Comprehensive, detailed explanations** for each example and concept.
- **Curated resources and links** to help you understand PyTorch fundamentals.

## Why This Repo?

While the official PyTorch tutorials are excellent, I often found myself needing more beginner-friendly explanations and step-by-step breakdowns. Here, I document my learning journey, sharing what I learned, how I understood it, and the resources that helped me.

## What You'll Find

- üìù **Annotated code** with comments and explanations.
- üìö **Links to helpful resources** for further reading.
- üí° **Beginner tips** and clarifications for common points of confusion.
- üîÑ **Modified examples** to illustrate concepts more clearly.

## Who Is This For?

- Beginners to PyTorch and deep learning.
- Anyone who prefers detailed, step-by-step explanations.
- Learners looking for additional resources and context.

## How to Use

1. Browse the folders and notebooks for topics you're interested in.
2. Read the explanations and comments alongside the code.
3. Check out the linked resources for deeper understanding.
4. Try running and modifying the examples yourself!
